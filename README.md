UP is a community driven project promotion application that allows creators to share and update their community on the work they are doing, to generate interest and donations to help support their work.

An interactive application, UP allows project organisers the ability to clearly share everything about their work, as well as provide updates, and connect through the integrated networking tools available. 

For community memebers it offers a platform to learn more about community and creative projects, offerin insights into innovations and artistic creations that any user can support through sharing, upvoting, and donations.

## categories

Not to be tied down to simple development projects, UP has been designed to support a range of different projects all geared towards community, development, and sustainability. From digital to creative to humanitarian, offering artists, developers, and communities the ability to promote and generate support for their work, through a feeless donations system utilising the IOTA network for fee-less transactions through the Firefly Wallet.

The three main categories are:
- Community
- Creative
- Technology

It couldn't be easier to get involved in the UP community. Registration is conencted to social login to retain a privacy focused system, and you can login through your LinkedIn, Google, or Facebook accounts.
